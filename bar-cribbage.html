            <p>
                Bar Cribbage is a traditional family game, which is a modification of Cribbage. My father, as a coding
                exercise, decided to recreate the game as a web application using Angular. I designed and developed the
                "front end", giving the game its signature appearance. This app uses Google Firebase for authentication
                and user setting management, although I was not involved in the implementation of these features or any
                of the game's functionality, outside of UI considerations.
