            <p>
                Lube-Tech V2 was the first enterprise-level web application that I ever worked on professionally. It was
                designed mostly by me, with occasional guidelines and assets provided by marketing and corporate. The
                site
                features extensive marketing materials and articles, as well as an eCommerce portion.
                A shining example of mobile-first design and development philosophy, the entire application has been
                engineered to be aesthetically and functionally pleasant on devices of all screen sizes. It was built in
                Angular 2+ and uses lazy-loaded components as faux "pages."
